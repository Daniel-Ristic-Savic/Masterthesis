# Masterthesis
As part of my masterâ€™s thesis, I conducted an industry analysis of the city of St. Gallen and visualized the results using various charts. The examples shown here include a location quotient and an employment growth diagram, both plotted using the SciencePlots style. These visualizations highlight sectoral specializations and growth trends.
