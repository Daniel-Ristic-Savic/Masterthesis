In my master’s thesis, I included three figures to visualize the empirical findings on path development in St. Gallen. The first figure illustrates employment growth across industries between 2011 and 2022, with a focus on those sectors exhibiting the strongest expansion. The second figure presents the location quotient, which situates St. Gallen’s sectoral specialization in relation to the national economy. The third figure depicts path dynamics by tracing the trajectories of selected industries over time, thereby highlighting processes of consolidation, diversification, or decline. All figures were generated from official employment data and plotted with standard statistical software to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
